# CSCI-1583---Project-4
Group project for Project 4 - Maze Game

11.5.24 Summary (Dom):

Page 14 out of 22 of initial code finished.
Fixed class issues with pages 11-13. Now added Player.java.
Code should run a fully imaged pop up with all the old assets.
Added some of the new assets for review:
Jack-O-Lantern = Gem
Candy = Food
Ghost = Enemy
Key = Key (lol)

Will work on the player, environment, and exit later today.

11.1.24 Summary (Dom):

Page 10 out of 22 of initial code finished.
MazeGame.java, Scene.java, and World.java are fully compiled and able to run.

Right now running "java MazeGame < Assets/world.txt" just returns a bunch of TRUEs and FALSEs and opens a blank standard draw file lol.

Stuck on page 11. I think it has to do with the StdDraw file? Not sure. I uploaded the prof StdDraw.java file to take a look later.
